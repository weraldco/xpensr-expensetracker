## xpensr - Expense Tracker

This personal project of mine is an Income and Expense Tracker designed to help monitor cash flowâ€”both income and expenses. I created it because I found it difficult to budget my money effectively. As I struggled with managing my finances, the idea came to me: What if I built an expense tracker to simplify this? And that's how I ended up with a tool that tracks all of my income and expenses.
